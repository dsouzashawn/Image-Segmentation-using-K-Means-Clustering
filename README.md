Sure! Here's a simplified explanation:

**Purpose:** This project is about splitting an image into different parts, making it easier to understand and analyze.

**How it works:** We use a technique called K Means Clustering, which groups similar pixels in an image together.

**Tech Stack:** Python is used for coding, along with libraries like OpenCV (for image processing), NumPy (for numerical operations), and Matplotlib (for visualization).

**Machine Learning Concept:** K Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It doesn't need labeled data. It works like this:
- Choose the number of groups (clusters) you want to find.
- Randomly put the pixels into these groups.
- Calculate the center of each group.
- Reassign pixels to the nearest group based on their distance from the centers.
- Repeat these steps until the groups don't change much.

That's it! It helps in various fields like self-driving cars and healthcare by providing a better understanding of images.
